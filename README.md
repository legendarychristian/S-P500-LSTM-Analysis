# SP500-LSTM-Analysis
More practice training an LSTM model and using it to predict stock trends!

# What I Have Learned
So here is the basic process of training an LSTM model (and this can be appled to training EVERY other model).

## Step 1
Split the data into training, testing, and valdation steps.

## Step 2
Define and scale the target and feature variables.

## Step 3
Prep the data for the model. <br/>
For an LSTM model, it needs to be in numpy format -> The data needs to be in shape (Data Length, Sequence Length, 1).

## Step 4
Define the architecture of the model.

## Step 5
Make predictions.

## Step 6
Train the model.

## Step 7
Evaluate the model's error and tweak the parameters to increase model accuracy.

## Step 8
Plot your predictions versus your test data :)
